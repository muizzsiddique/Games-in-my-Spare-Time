# Games Made in Python
A series of standalone games I'm coding in Python for my amusement.

#### To-do list: Connect Four
- [x] ~~Bug: When a column is filled either player can place another piece in that column and change players without changing the board.~~
- [x] ~~Bug: When the entire board is filled up and no one wins, no one draws and the game keeps taking input without updating the board.~~
- [x] ~~Change the board into a 1-dimensional list/array.~~
- [ ] Make the game loop to allow multiple rounds.

#### To-do list: Tic-tac-toe
- [x] ~~Rather than inputting coordinates make the user input an index instead.~~
- [ ] Make the game loop to allow multiple rounds.
